## Getting Started
- Must have **npm** installed
- Helpful if angular-1.5-cli (https://github.com/SwiftySpartan/Angular-1.5-cli) is installed globally - project was created with it
	- modifications were made to the initial project creation, used as boilerplate
- Run **npm install --save**
- Run **npm run serve** to start your local server
